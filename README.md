Introduction
============

Moosh stands for MOOdle SHell. It is a commandline tool that will allow you to perform most common Moodle tasks. It's inspired by Drush - a similar tool for Drupal.
moosh is licenced under GNU GPL v3 or any later.

I've created it when I realized how much time I waste each time I debug/test some Moodle issue and need to setup my environment.
Here is for example how you can create 5 Moodle user accounts with moosh:

    cd /moodle/root/installation
    moosh user-create user_{1..5}


Requirements
============

PHP 5.3+, Moodle 1.9, 2.3 or higher.

the form accordingly.

class. It will also display a boilerplate code on how can you use the form.
