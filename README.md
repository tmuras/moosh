Introduction
============

Moosh stands for MOOdle SHell. It is a commandline tool that will allow you to perform most common Moodle tasks. It's inspired by Drush - a similar tool for Drupal.
moosh is licenced under GNU GPL v3 or any later.

I've created it when I realized how much time I waste each time I debug/test some Moodle issue and need to setup my environment.
Here is for example how you can create 5 Moodle user accounts with moosh:

    cd /moodle/root/installation
    moosh user-create user_{1..5}


Installation
============

Clone moosh github repository:

    git clone git@github.com:tmuras/moosh.git

Link to a location that is set in your $PATH, eg:

    ln -s $PWD/moosh/moosh.php ~/bin/moosh

Or system-wide:

    sudo ln -s $PWD/moosh/moosh.php /usr/local/bin/moosh

Search and list files from mdl_files table. The argument should be a valid SQL WHERE statement. Interesting columns of possible search criterias are:
contextid, component, filearea, itemid, filepath, filename, userid, filesize, mimetype, status, timecreated, timemodified.

The output will contain some defaults or nearly all possible file information if "-a|--all" flag is provided. The meaning of the flags column is (in order):

 * mdl_files.status
 * lowercase letter "d" if entry is a dicrectory

With "-i" option only IDs are returned. This can be used when pipe-ing into other file-related commands.

    moosh file-delete 10 20 30

Example 2: Remove all files with size greater than 100 bytes
