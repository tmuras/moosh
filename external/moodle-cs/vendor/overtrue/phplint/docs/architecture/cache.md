# Cache

PHPLint uses the [Symfony Cache Component][symfony/cache] to speed-up execution of new re-analysis.

## Null Cache Adapter

This adapter allow to store/do nothing, but keep API homogeneous.

## Filesystem Cache Adapter

This [adapter][filesystem-adapter] stores the cache item contents (file fingerprint) as regular files in a collection
of directories on a locally mounted filesystem (default to `.phplint.cache` directory into the working directory).

You can change this directory with the `cache` option. See [Configuration](../configuration.md#cache-cache) chapter.
