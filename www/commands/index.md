Commands
========

activity-add
------------

Adds an activity instance to the specified course. The activity is specified by it's component name
without the plugin type prefix, so "forum", "assign" or "data" for example, and the course is specified
by it's id.
Usually you will want to use "-n, --name=" option to set the name of the activity.

See [Moodle forum post](https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=368091) about using the options. 

Example 1. Add new assignment activity to course with id 2.

    moosh activity-add assign 2

Example 2. Add forum to section 3 of course 4.

    moosh activity-add --section 3 forum 4
    
Example 3. Add lesson named "The first lesson" to course 2.

    moosh activity-add --name "The first lesson" lesson 2
    
Example 4. Add assignment with name "Easy assignment" and idnumber "ASD123" to course 2.

    moosh activity-add --name "Easy assignment" --section 2 --idnumber "ASD123" assign 2
    
Example 5. Add quiz "more emails" with intro set to "polite orders", network address restriction set to 192.168.2.2 to course 33.

    moosh activity-add -n 'more emails' -o="--intro=\"polite orders.\" --subnet=192.168.2.2" quiz 33
    
Example 6. Add scorm "scorm1" with description "my intro ABC" and forcenewattempt set to yes to course 2.

Example 1: set the name of a single URL resource with instance(!) id=151

    moosh activity-config-set activity 151 url name "Examinee handbook"

    moosh course-enrol-change-status 2

Example1 : change course enrolment instance status to disable for instance 42

    moosh course-enrol-change-status -i=42 -s=1 2

course-enableselfenrol
----------------------

Enable self enrolment on one or more courses given a list of course IDs. By default self enrolment is enabled without an enrolment key, but one can be passed as an option.

Example 1: Enable self enrolment on a course without an enrolment key

    moosh course-enableselfenrol 3

Example 2: Enable self enrolment on a course with an enrolment key

    moosh course-enableselfenrol --key "an example enrolment key" 3

course-info
-----------

Shows basic information about given course ID.
This command will also clear course cache, to measure how much time the cache rebuild takes.

Example 1: Show statistics for course ID 2.

    moosh course-info 2  

Example 2: Show statistics for course ID 2 - display in CSV format.

    moosh course-info -c 2  


course-last-visited
-------------------

Shows how many hours ago any user has last visited the course.

Example 1: How many hours ago course ID 2 was visited.

    moosh course-last-visited 2

course-list
-----------

Lists courses that match your search criteria. As an argument you can provide an SQL fragment, 
that is simply injected after WHERE clause when searching for courses.
All cli argument(s) will be concateneted together, so there is no need to 
quote SQL into single argument. But on the other hand, you need to escape quotes, so they are not eaten by your shell.
Run command with global "-v" option to see the actual SQL used for search (`moosh -v course-list`).
There are also quite a few options that modify the behaviour - see `moosh course-list --help` for complete list.  

Example 1: List all courses with full name containing phrase 'student'

    moosh course-list "fullname like '%student%'"

Example 2: List above but as separate arguments - quotes are escaped

    moosh course-list fullname like \'%student%\'

Example 3: List only empty courses from category 1

    moosh course-list -c 1 -e yes

course-move
-----------

Moves one or more courses into a given category.

Example 1: Move the course with ID 5 into the category with ID 2.

    moosh course-move 5 2

Example 2: Move courses with IDs 5, 6, 7, and 10 into the category with ID 2.

    moosh course-move 5,6,7,10 2

course-reset
------------

Reset course by ID. With -s or --settings option you can provide any supported setting for the restore. The value for
 -s option is a string with each setting in format key=value separated by space. This means you'll need to quote this
  string with double or single quotes when running the command. unenrol_users setting requires an array as a value -
  put at least one comma character (,) as a value to make moosh convert that into an array. Example:

    moosh course-reset -s "reset_forum_all=1 reset_data=0 unenrol_users=6," 17

Add -n or --no-action to display all reset setting that would be used on course restore. When -n is used, no action is
  actually performed.

dev-langusage
-------------

The command parses PHP file given as an argument. If the argument points to directory, 
then all the .php files inside it ae parsed.
A parser will look for the use of language strings, that is calls to get_string(), print_string(), string_for_js().
It then checks if the string is known by the string_manager - that is, if the sting is listed in the lang file.
With -l / --lang flag you may include and check against any lang file.

You can also use some special values:

 * course=NNN to list all files that relate to a course

The output will contain some defaults or nearly all possible file information if "-a|--all" flag is provided. The meaning of the flags column is (in order):

 * mdl_files.status
 * lowercase letter "d" if entry is a dicrectory
 * "e" if external file
 * "i" if a valid image
 * "m" if time created and time modified differ

With "-i" option only IDs are returned. This can be used when pipe-ing into other file-related commands.

Use the -m option to list files that exsist on the {files} DB table but are missing from the file system,
and add -r option to remove them from the {file} DB table.

Example 1: Show all legacy files for a course, which context id is 15

    moosh file-list "contextid=15 AND component='course' AND filearea='legacy'"
